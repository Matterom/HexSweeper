----How to play----
-------------------

Start a new game

Select a difficulty

Left click on a hex to reveal the tile.

Right click on a hex to mark it as a mine

The number determines the amount of mines hidden within adjacent hexagons

an empty hexagon will reveal all nearby empty hexagons

The amount of remaining flags lets you know how many mines are in the field

When all flags are placed, the game will check your work, if all the flags are on mines, and you have not overflagged, you win.

if you are overflagged nothing happens

if you reveal a mine, you loose, and the minefield is revealed.
